There are 3 types of data skew in salesforce:

Account data skew
Ownership skew
Lookup Skew

Owner Data Skew ? By deleting record or by changing owner of record.
	Try to limit the children to 10,000 while designing the architecture, for this you can assign the children by using the Round Robin algorithm with the help of custom settings for the child and parent objects.
You can adopt the public Read/Write sharing model, where the parent account stays locked and the calculations still occur.
If the skewed accounts are there, then you can re-distribute the child objects to reduce the record-level hurdles.

Limit number of selections from multi-select picklist.
	Validation Rule : 
		IF(INCLUDES(Multi_Picklist__c, "A"),1,0) + 
		IF(INCLUDES( Multi_Picklist__c, "B"),1,0) + 
		IF(INCLUDES( Multi_Picklist__c, "C"),1,0) + 
		IF(INCLUDES( Multi_Picklist__c, "D"),1,0) + 
		IF(INCLUDES( Multi_Picklist__c, "E"),1,0) > 3

Named Credentials as Callout Endpoints:
Named Credentials - “using Named Credential, we can make call out to external system without supplying username or Password”.
	Create Connected App
	Create Authorization Provider
	Define Named Credential
	Use Apex to connect in 5 lines of code
	
		HttpRequest feedRequest = new HttpRequest();
		feedRequest.setEndpoint('callout:Salesforce_Org/services/data/v32.0');
		//callout:[Named Credential Name]/[Callout URL of other Salesforce Org]

What are platform event? event driven architecture "Enterprise Message Platform"
There is subscriber and publisher communicate with each other through event. //Process builder and trigger
 This is just like custom object. Suffix is "__e"
 We can create custom fileds in platform event.
	checkbox,date,datetime,number,text,textarea
	Standard Field : Created By, Created Date, Replay Id 
	You can't query SOQL or SOSL on Platform event
	you can't use platform event in report / listview/search
	publish platform event cant be rollback
	platform event fields are readonly
	only after insert trigger are supported
	you can access platform event through API and declarative
	you can controll platform event through profile and permission.
	you can raise platform event through Batch class by implementing Database.RasesPlatformEvent

Difference between SOSL and Soql

SOSL : (Salesforce object search language)
record limit : 2000
work on multiple object
serach on text, email and phone

SOQL:(Salesforce Object Query Language)
Record Limit : 50k
Work on single object or related obect
Can not use text area, encrypted field in where clause.
We can not compare two column of same object in where clause.

 Best practice to write trigger ? 
	write only one trigger. 
	Salesforce not sure about execution of sequence of trigger. 
	Trigger Should be bulkify, 
	Always use Trigger context variable.
	Avoid DML or Soql in Trigger,

What is  the Difference between Workflow and visual flow?
What is difference between Workflow and Process builder?
	Workflow 
		Immediate calling workflow/
		Time dependent workflow
		it has four major operation here .
			Send Mail
			Create Task
			Update field
			outbound message : end point url: Criteria: User Send By :
		It is basically worked on single object.
		Run in system Mode		
	Process builder 
	
		The Process start when	
			Record Change
			A platform event occur
			Its invoked by another process		
			
		Action:
			Apex
			Create Record
			Update Record
			Flow
			Process
			Email Alert
			Post to chatter
			Quick Action
			Submit for approval			
				Used multiple object here. 
		It is basically worked on multiple objects. You can not send outbound message in Process builder
		Process Builder runs in the system mode so the object and field level permissions both will be ignored for the user who triggers the Process.
		
 What is difference between Process builder and Visual flow ?
	System mode: – In which the object and field-level permissions of the current user are ignored.
	User mode: – In which the permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules of the current user are enforced.
	Flow runs in user mode.
	Process Builder runs in system mode.
	When you launch a Flow using the Process Builder, then it will run in system mode.
